# Disleksikon

This app...

... won a prize on a two days hackathon organized by Goce Delcev Univesity of Shtip.

It's an app for kids with Dyslexia that allows them to learn the alphabet, new words with ease
and helps them with reading comprehension.

Big shout out to my team -> Strashe Naumov and Save Trajkov making this possible !

We rock
